Interactive Voice Recognition Windows Application

AI-Voice-Recognition-Visual-Studios
Overview
The AI Voice Recognition Windows Application is an open-source desktop application built using Visual Studio that allows users to interact with their computers through voice commands. This application integrates advanced Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to enable hands-free control, providing an interactive experience for users.
This application supports a range of voice commands and is designed for accessibility, automation, and improved user interaction with software. The project uses Microsoft’s Speech SDK for speech recognition and processing, enabling seamless integration with Windows-based applications.
This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
Features	•	Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text in real time using the Microsoft Speech SDK.	•	Voice Command Processing: Handles and processes predefined voice commands to trigger actions within the application (e.g., open files, control media, perform calculations).	•	Natural Language Processing: Processes complex voice inputs and understands the user’s intent through simple NLP techniques.	•	Windows Desktop Integration: Full integration with Windows operating system functionalities, such as opening applications, controlling volume, or interacting with files and directories.	•	Real-Time Feedback: Provides audible and visual feedback to the user, confirming successful command recognition and actions.	•	Custom Command Set: Allows the addition of custom voice commands for tailored use cases, such as controlling home automation devices or interacting with custom applications.	•	Hands-Free Operation: Designed to allow users to operate their computer without needing a keyboard or mouse.
Installation
Prerequisites
Before setting up and running the AI Voice Recognition Windows Application, ensure the following software and components are installed:	•	Visual Studio (Community Edition or higher) with support for C# and .NET applications.	•	Download from Visual Studio Downloads.	•	Microsoft Speech SDK: The Speech SDK is required for speech-to-text functionality.	•	Install from Microsoft Speech SDK.	•	.NET Framework: Ensure that .NET Framework 4.7 or later is installed on your system.	•	Install from Microsoft .NET Framework.
Steps to Set Up	1.	Clone the Repository:Clone the project repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Voice-Recognition-Visual-Studios.gitcd AI-Voice-Recognition-Visual-Studios

	2.	Open the Project in Visual Studio:	•	Open Visual Studio.	•	Select File > Open > Project/Solution.	•	Navigate to the cloned repository folder and open the .sln file to load the solution into Visual Studio.	3.	Install Dependencies:	•	Ensure the Microsoft Speech SDK is installed in the project.	•	Open the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio and install any missing dependencies.Example (via NuGet Package Manager):
Install-Package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech

	4.	Configure Microphone Access:	•	Ensure that your computer’s microphone is set up and accessible for speech input.	•	You may need to configure permissions in Windows Settings for microphone access.	5.	Build and Run the Application:	•	Press F5 or Build > Start Debugging in Visual Studio to compile and run the application.	•	Once the application starts, it will begin listening for voice commands.
Usage
Once the application is up and running, it will listen for voice commands and execute associated actions. Below are some of the key features and interactions:
1. Start Listening for Voice Commands	•	The application starts by listening for a keyword or trigger phrase (e.g., “Hey Computer”).	•	Once the keyword is recognized, the app begins listening for further instructions.
Example of command handling:
// Start speech recognition on application startSpeechRecognizer recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer();recognizer.StartContinuousRecognitionAsync();
// Handle recognized speechrecognizer.Recognized += (sender, e) =>{    string command = e.Result.Text.ToLower();    if (command.Contains("open notepad"))    {        // Open Notepad if command is recognized        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("notepad");    }};
2. Voice Command Examples	•	“Open Notepad”: Opens the Notepad application.	•	“Play music”: Starts playing music or opens a music player.	•	“Close application”: Closes the currently active application or window.	•	“What’s the weather today?”: Fetches the weather using an external API.	•	“Scroll down”: Scrolls the current window down by one page.	•	“Turn up the volume”: Increases the system volume.
3. Custom Commands
You can define custom commands for specific tasks or actions. These can range from opening applications to controlling smart devices.
Example of custom command registration:
// Register custom command for controlling mediarecognizer.Recognized += (sender, e) =>{    if (e.Result.Text.Contains("pause music"))    {        PauseMusic();    }};
void PauseMusic(){    // Logic to pause music playback}
4. Feedback Mechanisms	•	The application provides audible feedback after recognizing a command. For example, after successfully opening Notepad, it will say, “Notepad is now open.”	•	Visual feedback can also be provided, such as updating the UI with a message or showing a confirmation prompt.
5. Stopping the Application	•	Users can stop the listening process by saying “Stop listening” or by manually closing the application.
recognizer.StopContinuousRecognitionAsync();
6. Error Handling	•	If the system fails to recognize a command or encounters an issue, the application will notify the user with an error message or prompt them to repeat the command.
